                    Crafted the Solids Projection Simulator, an innovative Python-based project
                    focused on automating the projection of solids using the Python Turtle library.
                    This simulation tool accurately projects hexagonal pyramids and prisms onto a
                    2D plane, employing mathematical calculations for precise visualizations and
                    providing a user-friendly interface for experimentation and learning.
